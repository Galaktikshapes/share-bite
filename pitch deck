SHAREBITE â€“ Final PLP Pitch Deck
Turning Surplus Into Support
By Thapelo Makgakga
Built with Flutter & Firebase
SDG 2: Zero Hunger | SDG 12: Responsible Consumption

INTRO: WHY SHAREBITE EXISTS
ðŸ¥« "We throw away enough food to feed 30M people daily... while 20% of South Africans face hunger."

ShareBite bridges this absurd gap through a real-time donation network that connects:
â€¢ Households with surplus food/clothing
â€¢ Businesses reducing daily waste
â€¢ Communities in immediate need

THE VISION
To become South Africa's most trusted hyperlocal sharing economy â€“ where every surplus item finds someone who needs it within 5km.

HOW IT WORKS
10-Second Onboarding

Smart role selection (Donor/Recipient/Business)

Firebase Auth secures all interactions

Lightning-Fast Listings

Donors: Snap photo â†’ Describe â†’ Post (45sec)

Recipients: See real-time donations via Cloud Firestore

Frictionless Connections

In-app messaging for pickup logistics

Verified donor/receiver profiles

TECHNICAL HIGHLIGHTS
Core Stack:
â€¢ Flutter (iOS/Android/Web from single codebase)
â€¢ Firebase Auth (Secure access control)
â€¢ Cloud Firestore (Realtime donation feed)

Key Features:
âœ“ Dynamic role-based UI rendering
âœ“ Smart form validation
âœ“ Offline-first data sync
âœ“ Material 3 design system

TARGET USER GROUPS
User Segment	Pain Point Solved	Key Benefit
Households	"I hate wasting good items but don't know who needs them"	Guilt-free decluttering
Small Businesses	"We have daily surplus but no distribution channel"	Tax-deductible donations
Community Centers	"Struggle to source specific items for beneficiaries"	Real-time need matching
IMPACT METRICS
Per 1,000 Users:

â€¢ Basic user profiles

Next 3 Months:
â€¢ Geolocation radius filters
â€¢ Donation claim verification
â€¢ Business donor analytics

2025:
â€¢ OCR receipt scanning
â€¢ Corporate social impact dashboards
â€¢ WhatsApp integration

COST STRUCTURE
Phase 1 (Current):
â€¢ Firebase Spark Plan: R0
â€¢ Domain/Hosting: R150/year
â€¢ Total: R150

At Scale:
â€¢ Firebase Blaze Plan: ~R800/month
â€¢ Google Maps API: R300/month
â€¢ Moderation Team: R5,000/month
